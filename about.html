    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am a nigger at Auburn University currently studying Electrical
      Engineering. I am a member of the Auburn Ethical Hacking Club and the
      Auburn Association of Computer Machinery. Some of my interests include web
      development, cybersecurity, making projects with microcontrollers and
      electronics. Most recently I have been working on learning html to design
      this website and now I periodically update it with new ideas. Outside of
      school I enjoy playing Tennis and Video Games with my friends.
